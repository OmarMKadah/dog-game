## Description

_This application was designed to be a representation of what it means to own and take care of a dog, including the consequences. Our target audience are people who may work or go to school and only have a limited amount of time in the evenings. The ultimate goal once you begin the simulation, is to tire your dog out as much as possible before your bedtime- 21:00. The game starts at 16:00. You will be rewarded in cash as part of your simulated training, depending on how much energy your dog has before your bedtime.

If your dog's energy level is between:
* _0-10: you will earn $25 and have a good night's rest_
* _11-50: you will earn $15 and sleep well for most of the night_
* _51-90: you will earn $10, but not sleep very well_
* _91-100: you will not earn any money; you did not sleep well_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository onto your desktop_
* _Open files in your preferred text editor or browser_
* _Begin game_


_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
